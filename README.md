VArify

Welcome to VArify, the website that will end your endless searching for the voice you recognize when watching anime. 
There's a lot of information on the internet, especially when finding a well-known person, but sometimes the data can be misleading or confusing.

Our team decided to make a centralized hub to find any voice actor according to the character name or Voice actor name. 
The features don't end there as you can see a list of shows and pick and choose and find out who voiced the characters if you don't have a specific voice to unmask. 

We came about this idea while jotting down our interest and talking about a manageable project. 
To our surprise, it wasn't such an easy task as there were creative roadblocks and technical complications.
Since I believe this was our first group project as developers where we all take an individual role, there was a bit of uncertainty of the project's direction, 
but it doesn't mean we weren't excited to work with each other. 
As a matter of fact, all of our meetings went well, the energy was always high, and we were still willing to take on new ideas. 

We were thankful to have such a great team. Our team name is BOAT, and we consist of:
Brian Ross -
Our Amazing back-end web lead had to work on our API for the site. 
He worked very diligently, and I think I can say for all of the BOAT, we wouldn't be this far without his work.

Anneka Curry-
An Outstanding Front-end web lead, she is the best when it comes to making beautiful front-end work. 
I would go check out her work as she is very talented. 
The guys on the team were very grateful we had such a great front-end web engineer.

Tristan Briseno- 
A Superb SCRUM master and Git/GitHub lead, our project wouldn't have progressed so far without him. 
He always had an idea to bring to the table and asked the critical question:
what are we doing next, and how will the features be working. He also brought a lot of energy to the team as he was easygoing and an amiable guy.

Omar Conda- 
The design lead of the team, he tried his best. He created the user journey and wireframes of the project. 
He brought ideas to the table for his team to improve upon. 
He brought up conversation and positivity to the group.

Future Iterations :
We seek to add new features to the site; since it is in development, we still have a long way to go for future features we seek to add: 

a login/sign up page

a profile page where users can add favorite VA's to share

a form page for feedback and help 

Seek to add more than just anime and add other types of voice acting
